## Introduction

The SmartSecure Locker System is a versatile and scalable IoT-based solution designed to provide secure and efficient storage in a variety of shared environments such as universities, gyms, offices and libraries. The system connects multiple locker locations, allowing users to check real-time availability via a mobile or web application. If lockers at a preferred location are fully occupied, the system intelligently suggests the nearest alternative location, offering a seamless and flexible user experience.

Access is secured through a figerprint sensor, ensuring safety and convenience. Users can reserve lockers, receive notifications, and navigate to alternative locations with ease. Administrators can manage locker usage and monitor the system through a centralized dashboard. This solution reduces theft risks, optimizes locker utilization, and provides a modern, adaptable storage system suitable for various community-driven environments.
